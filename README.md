# Introduction
Introducing our Telegram bot for monitoring financial products. This bot is designed to help users track the prices of their financial assets and provide updates in a convenient and efficient manner. The features include:

Price Monitoring: The bot monitors a list of financial products and sends alerts to the user's Telegram when certain conditions are met. This helps users stay informed and react to market changes in a timely manner.

Daily Sum Up Report: When the market is open, the bot sends a daily summary of the tracked financial products to the user's Telegram, providing a quick and easy reference for their performance.

Future features in development:

Dynamic Asset Monitoring: We're working on implementing a user-friendly UI that will allow users to easily add or remove asset monitoring events, giving them better control over their portfolio management.

ChatGPT API Integration: We plan to integrate ChatGPT API to provide AI-powered financial insights and recommendations, enhancing the bot's functionality and delivering valuable information to users.
